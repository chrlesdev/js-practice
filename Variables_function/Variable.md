After relearning JavaScript variables, I understand that let and const were created to prevent common mistakes caused by var.

var is function-scoped, meaning it is limited to the function where it is declared, but it ignores block scope and is hoisted with an initial value of undefined, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
let and const are safer because they respect block scope and prevent redeclaration.

I also learned that JavaScript has dynamic types, meaning a variable’s type is determined at runtime using typeof.
Some behaviors, such as typeof null returning "object", are historical quirks that developers must remember when writing reliable code.

java Script Variable:

```
Var
let
const
```

java script types:

```
String
Number
Bigint
Boolean
Object
Undefined
Null
```
